<h2>Lost Cellphone in the Toxic Woods</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Guide the character through the woods collecting the phones without hitting the harmful objects.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Thought on the speed they need to go at to be able to avoid the traps, get the phones, and reach the end of the level.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
adventure, collector
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The character automatically moves forward at a certain speed. The player can slow down to an extent by holding the left arrow button and speed up by releasing it. Hit the up arrow key to jump. Use these to navigate the dangerous woods, collect as many phones as you can and move on to the next section. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Character that can only be controlled to a limited extent with multiple levels increasing the minimum and max speed depending on the level.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The not quite total control over the character which allows the player to navigate the level, but adds difficulty because the character cannot be completely stopped.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
Person searching a dangerous forest for a lost cell phone.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
NA
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
casual
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
a couple minutes at most.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Effective use of slowing the character and speeding up. When moving at full speed the character can jump larger obstacles, but it is difficult to time the jump correctly. When moving slowly the jump is easier to time, but harder to actually get over. One effective tactic would be to slow down until in the air and release the key to speed up so that the character will avoid the danger.
